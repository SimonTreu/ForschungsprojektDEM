# Protocol of the research project

## Project Structure

### `/source`
This folder contains all Yade scripts. In `/basic_examples` are 
scripts that should help to understand the basics of yade. `/sinkhole_model` contains
contains two scripts to demonstrate a simple sinkhole model
### `/data`
No files in this folder are committed to git. It should contain 
any files created by a yade script (Specific element-ensembles or
trajectory files for postprocessing)
### `/docker`
dockerfile to compile yade in a docker container. It installs all
dependencies do compile yade. It is also possible to install yade 
 without compiling it via the yadedaily package (see yade doc).

## Installation

To install yade on a ubuntu system follow the instructions on 
[yadehomepage](https://yade-dem.org/doc/installation.html).
If you want/need to compile yade on your own machine
I would recommend to use a docker container. You could use 
`docker/dockerfile` for that.

## Understanding Yade

Yade is a emplementation of the Descrete Element Method ([wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskrete-Elemente-Methode), 
[yade-docu](https://yade-dem.org/doc/formulation.html), [Cundall, Strack 1979](https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1680/geot.1979.29.1.47)).
This method was developed to simulate the mechanical behaviour of a medium by describing it as a set of "discrete" or "distinct" elements and interaction
laws between such elements. It is also possible to apply body forces such as gravity that are independent of interactions. 
The most popular (due to its computational simplicity) discrete elements a spheres. Any discrete element can have material
specific properties such as density and tension, which may change after an interaction.
A time step of a simulation consits of:
    1. listing all interactions between particles (all particles that are within an interaction range of each other).
    2. compute forces between interacting particles
    3. apply body forces
    4. use newtons 2nd law to compute resulting momentum.
    5. update positions of particles
For numerical stability there is a upper bound for the size of a single time step `PWaveTimeStep()`


### External Documentation Sources

The documentation you are reading here is mainly based on documentation documents you can
find on the [yade website](https://yade-dem.org/doc/). To get a html document containing all
different documentation files go to [Full contents](https://yade-dem.org/doc/index-toctree.html).
That documentation is a good starting point to get an understanding of how to use Yade but it lacks 
discriptions as soon as you try to go beyond the basic examples and functions. 

A good way of finding out how to do more difficult tasks (such as sinkhole simulations) I would recommend a iterative 
approach: 
    1. Find related posts in the [forum](https://answers.launchpad.net/yade)
    2. Check the documentation of mentioned functions (Quicksearch on [yade website](https://yade-dem.org/doc/) works quite well for that)
    3. Find publications where those functions are used (or even developed) [yade related publications](https://yade-dem.org/doc/publications.html). 
    4. Search the forum again for posts related to the functions you might want to use.
    5. Check out [examples on github](https://github.com/yade/trunk/tree/master/examples).

### Basic Example

#### Basic Sphere

The file `source/basic_example/basic_sphere` is a minimalistic YADE script. The building blocks of 
a simulations are:

1. Add material properties for particles to simulation [as described here](https://yade-dem.org/doc/user.html#defining-materials)
    * if no material is defined,
    [default material properties](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.utils.html?highlight=defaultmaterial#yade.utils.defaultMaterial)
     are used for all particles.
    * if only one material is added it is used for all particles.
    * if multiple materials are added to the simulation they can be assigned to particles
    by an id, which is returned by `O.materials.append(...)` 
2. Define particles (here two spheres)
    * the module [utils](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.utils.html) contains 
    several helper functions to create particles of different shapes and types.
    The most commonly used one is the 
    [sphere creator](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.utils.html#yade.utils.sphere)
    *  to define fixed particles as boundary conditions set `sphere(...,fixed=True,...)`. Such spheres don`t move in space
    but behave otherwise normally with other particles.
3. Add the particles to the simulation. The static object O (Omega) contains all parameters of a simulation model. All 
    particles have to be appended to the O.bodies object.
4. Define simulation logic in the O.engines object. 
    * InsertionSortCollider() takes care of a first approximate interaction detection. `InsertionSortCollider([Bo1_Sphere_Aabb()])` dose that
    by checking if simple boxes containing the objects are overlapping. If such an approximate interaction is a real interaction is handled within the
    interaction loop (which is looping over all approximate interactions).
    * `InteractionLoop` is described [here](https://yade-dem.org/doc/introduction.html#interactions).
    * `NewtonIntegrator` computes the momentum from all forces for each particle.
 5. `O.dt` sets the length of one timestep. It has to be a value that is smaller than PWaveTimeStep().
 
 ####  Sinkhole Model
 This model is an adaption of the model given in this [example on github](https://github.com/yade/trunk/tree/master/examples/jointedCohesiveFrictionalPM).
 The readmee mentions several related publications (artong2012a, Scholtes2012, Scholtes2013, Duriez2016 [see references](https://yade-dem.org/doc/publications.html))
 As those authors also implemented a lot of the used functions it is recommended to refer to those
 publications for a detailed explanation. The aim of this model is to implement a model that contains
 a box of fixed spheres as boundary condition. (only the side walls are fixed). A layer of cohesive
 material (i.e. solid rock) on the bottom that is held only by the fixed walls (the outer borders of the
 solid stone plate are fixed). The Box is filled with a loose material which has no cohesive forces.
 
 Every 0.1 second of virtual time we remove a sphere from the center of the solid material. After some 
 time parts of the solid material will break and free the loose material on top.
 
 ##### packing_in_cuboid.py
 
 Here we create a packing of spheres in a cuboid (put as many spheres
 into that cuboid). This pack of spheres will be the bases for our model.
 it is saved in the /data directory with the filename starting with alignedBox. 
 This file can be used in a different simulation. With that method it is
 possible to base different kind of simulations on the same sphere packing
 or use different sphere packings for the same simulation.
 
 ##### sinkhole.py

The first important thing here is the definition of material properties. We have on Material called
nonCohesiveMaterial for the loose spheres and one cohesive material property for the spheres representing
solid stone. When we load the spheres from the packing created with `pycking_in_cuboid.py` we first
assign all spheres with the cohesive material. But then we check which spheres lie outside the boundary
conditions and assign the nonCohesive material to it.

Secondly some spheres are selected for removal during the simulation.
    
        PyRunner(command='removeNextSphere()',  virtPeriod=0.1),

within the interaction loop arbitrarily selects one of those spheres for removal every 0.1 seconds
of virtual time (simulated time and not the real time the simulation takes).

The variable `interactionRadius` can be set to values larger than one. If you do so, then the initial
cohesive links will be also applied to particles that are close by and not only if they are touching.
Higher values of the `interactionRadius` correspond to a harder material. Please read 
[Scholtes2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509612002268) for further 
explanation of that method.

Cohesive links are only set up in the first step of the simulation. After that the interaction
detection factor (which made it possible to stick particles together that are not directly touching)
is reset to one. 

    O.step();
    #### initializes now the interaction detection factor to strictly 1
    ss2d3dg.interactionDetectionFactor = -1.
    is2aabb.aabbEnlargeFactor = -1.


#### VTK Recorder (saving trajectories)
    
It is possible to save trajectories of the simulation at some rate (for example every 500th iteration).
[yade docu](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.export.html). For a explanation on how to 
visualize such trajectories you may refer to the [official vtk website](https://www.vtk.org/)

#### FAQ

* What is WallMask in geom.facetBox?
	* wallMask (bitmask) â€“ determines which walls will be created, in the order -x (1), +x (2), -y (4), +y (8), -z (16), +z (32). The numbers are ANDed; the default 63 means to create all walls
	* see [documentation](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.geom.html)

* What is a ForceResetter() 
	* A Class that will Reset all forces stored in Scene::forces (O.forces in python). Typically, this is the first engine to be run at every step. In addition, reset those energies that should be reset, if energy tracing is enabled.
* What is a InsertionSortCollider()?
	* It is a special kind of Collider using Insertion Sort to gain a complexity of $O(n \log(n))$ complexity using Aabb (Axis-aligned bounding box) for bounds. [docu](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.wrapper.html#yade.wrapper.InsertionSortCollider)

* What is a Collider?
	* [docu](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.wrapper.html#yade.wrapper.Collider)

* What is an Aabb (Axis-aligned bounding box)?
	* It is a box around a given object. To check if to objects collide, it is first checked if those boxes are touching, if yes a IGeomFunctor checks if the more complicated objects collide.
