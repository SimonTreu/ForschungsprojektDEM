# Getting Started with spheres

## Introduction
This tutorial is based on the example [Bouncing Spheres](https://yade-dem.org/doc/tutorial-examples.html#bouncing-sphere).
It will give you a basic introduction to the core
elements within a Yade-simulation and lets you
explore some parameters on your own.

## Create a sphere
First of all we need to create the script for our simulation.
Create a python-file called `my_bouncing_sphere.py`.

to create a sphere we can use the function [utils.sphere](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.utils.html?highlight=utils.sphere#yade.utils.sphere)
